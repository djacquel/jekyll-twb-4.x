## Using Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap 4.x

### Why this starter kit ?

 - to use the last Twitter Bootstrap 4.x 'nearly' out of the box.
 - to tweek templates and includes (IMAO gem based themes are crap). Here, everything is in place to start tinkering.

### Dependencies

In order to play, you'll need :

 - a *nix* box (sorry, no Win support here),
 - [git](https://git-scm.com/),
 - ruby >= 2.4.2 preferably installed with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or rvm,
 - [bundler](http://bundler.io/),
 - [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) preferably installed with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm),
 - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or npm

### Install

Once every dependencies are met, you can :

- Clone this repo : ```git clone git@github.com:djacquel/jekyll-twb-4.x.git```
- ```yarn``` or ```npm install```
- you can now run jekyll with ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` if you play  or, with jekyll 3.7.x, you can use livereload ```bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload```
